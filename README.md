# Tiny PyHP

A simple, fast, tiny, bare-bones, lean, from the scratch implementation
which doesn't depend upon any 3rd party libraries except the standard
CRT and BSD OS libs.

...

Currently moving HTTP server related code to (TinyLittleHTTP)[https://github.com/SeriousSamV/TinyLittleHTTP] and having it as the upstream lib.
This repo will focus only on serving embeded Python scriptlets through PyHP files, rather than HTTP itself.
